/*Function of this script:

To calculate how many rendered cups of each food are necessary based on a given variable of how many people are being supported,
what kinds of meals people eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and what percentage of the time each meal is eaten. 

Accordingly, we will be separating the calculations into different meals and providing a list of the different types of food available,
then allowing for five different types of food combinations to be specified for each meal. Then we will allow the user to specify the percentage that each meal
will be eaten.
